## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anita and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

- ðŸ“š I recently completed an 8-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with JustIT training. I am looking to build on my skills and develop new skills to develop a career as a data analyst. I have completed several data projects using Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau and PowerBI which you can find here.
